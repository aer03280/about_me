         <h1>~Ashley Ross~</h1>
         <br />
         <p id="intro">So far, I’m just getting started as a coder.  I can write html, css, and javascript.
           I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of it and can’t wait to learn more!</p>
           <br />
           <br />
         <p id="firstPara"> My employment background is in the healthcare industry.  I received my Bachelor’s degree in Biology and a minor in Business.
           Most recently, I worked for a startup in that built software for doctors’ offices.
           I was a Project Manager and worked closely with the Development Team,
           which taught me a lot about the process of building software but no actual code.
           <br />
           <em>I decided to come to Codefellows for that.</em></p>
         <p id="secPara">This summer I went on a very long trip to Southeast Asia, India, Spain, Morocco, and several other
           countries you may not have heard of (like Andorra, for instance).
           It's a good I don't have any pets because I was gone for six months!
           This was quite difficult for my parents as I am an only child and they worried a lot.</p>
         <p id="thirdPara">It was an incredible journey and I learned a ton about other cultures.
           I even completed my yoga certification while I was in Thailand.</p>
